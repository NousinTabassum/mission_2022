            <p>As the year comes to a close, you may be considering making a New Year’s resolution. Maybe you made a
                resolution last year and stuck with it, or maybe you had totally forgotten about it by February. Maybe
                you don’t believe in making New Year’s resolutions.
                <br> <br> Regardless, it may help your planning if you have a better idea of what exactly a New Year’s
                resolution is and what it could be, too. A New Year’s resolution is a promise that you make to yourself
                or others to carry out an idea or action.

            <h2>Develop <br> Without Limits</h2>
            <p>People have been trying to find ways to improve their focus and cognitive capacities for thousands of
                years, and most ancient civilizations had some combination of mental exercise and herbal medicine to
                help them reach this goal.Today, we can use anything from apps to ancient meditation techniques to boost
                concentration and hone our mental skills. If you go through with this, you will be able to control your
                mood, learn faster and have an easier time solving problems.</p>

            <h2>Know our <br>Global Community</h2>
            <p>Most people in today’s world rely on a community for practical purposes. The necessities of life rarely
                come from one’s own hands, but rather from a complicated “web of mutuality,” as Martin Luther King,
                Jr.once phrased it. While most people need to be part of a community for life’s necessities, most people
                want to be part of a community because there is something indescribably lovely about being a part of a
                group of people who share something more substantial than geographical location. </p>
