            <p>As the year comes to a close, you may be considering making a New Year’s resolution. Maybe you made a
                resolution last year and stuck with it, or maybe you had totally forgotten about it by February. Maybe
                you don’t believe in making New Year’s resolutions.
                <br> <br> Regardless, it may help your planning if you have a better idea of what exactly a New Year’s
                resolution is and what it could be, too. A New Year’s resolution is a promise that you make to yourself
                or others to carry out an idea or action.

            <h2>Know our <br>Global Community</h2>
            <p>Most people in today’s world rely on a community for practical purposes. The necessities of life rarely
                come from one’s own hands, but rather from a complicated “web of mutuality,” as Martin Luther King,
                Jr.once phrased it. While most people need to be part of a community for life’s necessities, most people
                want to be part of a community a part of a
                group of people who share something more substantial than geographical location. </p>
